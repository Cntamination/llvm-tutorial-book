# LLVM Frontend Tutorial

This is the main repository for my LLVM tutorial.

*WARNING* all source code in this project is currently experimental and subject to changes on a whim. It may not even work correctly at this point. This project will remove this warning when the final compiler implmentation is completed.

Directories of the form compiler[x] are experimental.
The emerald directory will contain the reference implementation.

The project intention is to create a user friendly introduction to llvm, compilers, and programming language creation in general.

Through the chapters of this tutorial we will create a working compiler for a toy language. Initially we will keep the syntax very simple to get to a working product quickly and then iteratively build on new functionality and syntax to gradually make the toy language more expressive and powerful.

If anyone notices anything out of date or that is not factually correct, I welcome the knowledge. I am hoping to learn a lot from writing this.
